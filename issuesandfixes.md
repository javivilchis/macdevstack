### Issues and Fixes
There are a few issues on some silicone-based MacBook Pros, below you can see the list of encoutered issues when installing some applications.

## Issues:
**Docker installation** - Docker is warning that Docker Desktop is not starting on macOS due to malware warnings after some files were signed with an incorrect code-signing certificate.
The first reports of the malware alerts surfaced on January 7, 2025, when macOS users received an unexpected 'Malware Blocked' message preventing them from opening the Docker containers management app.

"Malware Blocked, "com.docker.vmnetd" was not opened because it contains malware. This action did not harm your Mac," reads the alert on Macs.
